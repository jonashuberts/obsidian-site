- Active recall
    - retrieving information from your brain
    - Questions are the best way of implementing it
- Spaced repetition
    - Spacing out when you revise
    - Write down when you are next going to revise a topic (1 week → 1 month → 3 months)
- Both together
    - Make questions after your notes
    - Review these questions after a week and then a month
    - Don't re-read the notes
- Use of it
    - **Creating flashcards** → The process of writing the flashcards is perfect for familiarizing yourself with what you need to remember.
    - **Teaching someone** → When you try to explain something to someone else, you're forced to explore it from multiple perspectives.
    - **Reading and remembering** → Read the short section and try to remember by repeating 5-10 times while keeping your eyes closed.
    - **Practice testing** → Take your notes and textbook and see if you can create a test from that. Take your practice exams just like you'd take your usual exams. No cheating!
    - For practive subjets like math create tests with chat gpt of search some of knowunity etc.
- Use also the Loci-Method
    
    ### Step 1: Create a memory route
    
    - The first step is to imagine a room that you know very well. It is best to go to this room. For example, this can simply be the living room of your apartment
    - Now you define so-called waypoints, which can be the following objects
    - It is important that you determine the order in which you will walk along the objects.
    - Write down your route so that you always keep the same order and don't forget in between which object was the second.
    - Try to retrace your route in your head and determine the order of the items.
    - It is recommended to have 10 items to remember per room. Gradually increase the number of items.
    - You can associate up to 50 or more pieces of information with items.
    
    ### Step 2: Link the memory route to the learning material
    
    - Once you can picture the memory route in your room in order, link the items to the information you need to memorize.
    
    ### Step 3: The repetition
    
    - To move the information from short-term memory to your long-term memory, repeat or go over the sequence in your space of information links over and over again.
- Protégé Effect
    - The *protégé effect* is a psychological phenomenon where teaching, pretending to teach, or preparing to teach information to others helps a person learn that information.
    - The protégé effect improves your learning process by increasing your metacognitive processing, increasing your use of effective learning strategies, increasing your motivation to learn the material, and increasing your feelings of competence and autonomy.
    - Beyond improving your ability to learn the material, teaching others can also lead to additional benefits, such as improved communication skills, increased confidence, and improved leadership ability.
    - To take advantage of the protégé effect, you can learn the material as if you’re going to teach it, pretend to teach it to someone, or teach it to other people in reality, or you can use some combination of these techniques.
    - When deciding which approach to use in order to benefit from the protégé effect, remember that the more realistic the teaching feels, the more you will benefit from it, but that any potential benefits must be weighed against potential costs, such as the time and effort involved in implementing any given technique.
- Feynman Technique
    
    ### **Step 1:**
    
    - Grab a sheet of paper and **write the name of the concept** at the top. You can use pretty much any concept or idea – even though the technique is named after Feynman, it’s not limited solely to math and science.
    
    ### **Step 2:**
    
    - Explain the concept in your own words **as if you were teaching it to someone else**. Focus on using plain, simple language. Don’t limit your explanation to a simple definition or a broad overview; challenge yourself to work through an example or two as well to ensure you can put the concept into action.
    - Do a voice recording and replay it later
    
    ### **Step 3:**
    
    - Review your explanation and identify the areas where you **[didn’t know something](https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-improve-memory/)** or where you **feel your explanation is shaky**. Once you’ve pinpointed them, go back to the source material, [your notes](https://collegeinfogeek.com/lecture-notetaking-systems/), or any examples you can find in order to shore up your understanding.
    
    ### **Step 4:**
    
    - If there are any areas in your explanation where you’ve used lots of technical terms or complex language, challenge yourself to **re-write these sections in simpler terms**. Make sure your explanation could be understood by someone without the knowledge base you believe you already have.
- Zeigarnik Effect

    ### **1/ Create Momentum**
    
    - The Zeigarnik effect shows us that we actually have everything to gain by starting a new task **as soon as possible**, especially if it is complex. Just getting down to it will have a very powerful impact on your motivation.
    - When you have **created this opening for the topic in question**, you will find that it will keep popping up in your mind, which will make you come back to it again and again until you have fully learned it.

    ### **2/ Plan Strategic Breaks to Improve Your Memory**
    
    - Taking short breaks while working on a task helps maintain the tension specific to this new area of learning. It can help **boost your memory** and make it easier to access relevant information.
    - [Studies](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/95743077.pdf) show that students who temporarily stop studying to do other activities (like playing video games or doing sport) will remember what they have just learned more easily than those who cram continuously.
    - To maintain your momentum, it is, therefore, advisable to **plan short breaks throughout the day**. Just be sure to do something completely unrelated to the task at hand.

    ### **3/ Conclude Your Day with a To-Do List**
    
    - In practice, it will not always be possible to apply the Zeigarnik effect to your working day. Not only will you not necessarily be able to dedicate yourself to a single topic, but it can also **fuel your desire to devote yourself to other tasks** and lead to anxiety or burnout.
    - To contain the negative potential of the Zeigarnik effect, try writing down a list of tasks that you haven’t yet completed at the end of the day. [A study from Florida State University](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/the-psychology-of-the-to-do-list.html) has shown that people who think about how they are going to complete a task **are less distracted by their unfinished work**.
    - Just recognizing that you still have a task in progress and writing it down when you think you will finish it will **reduce your level of stress and help you relax**. When you go back to it, you will be calmer and more able to concentrate

    ### **4/ Explore New Topics to Work On Neuroplasticity**
    
    It has also been demonstrated that neuroplasticity **plays a part in the process of learning.** In fact, learning, which consists of tackling a new and unknown task, requires the reorganization of certain neural networks in the brain to help the individual to adapt to the new task at hand or new knowledge discovered.
    
    Neuroplasticity is still relatively unknown today (or at least, its mechanisms are still difficult to understand), but it is clear that the better it is in an individual, **the more efficient learning will be,** and the more the brain will be able to heal certain wounds. This is a great challenge to boost your ability to tackle new tasks efficiently!
    
- General to specific, look at how subjects fit together
- focus on your weakness
- learning should be easy and efficient, don't make complex notes
- focus on understanding first, then learn it
- Use interleaving, learn topics in random order
- do mock exams
- have no flash card order -> randomize it
- use a blank sheet of paper and write down everything you remember and the add all missing information
- Do summarys off school material on small square sheet of paper and lern it and take it every where to study on the go
- Study in groups, it can give extra energy
- Study a little every day, not a lot before the exam
- Really use the learning tools, not just read or mark
- Don't think too seriously about all the school stuff, make it experimental
