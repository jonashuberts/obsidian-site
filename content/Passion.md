# Facts

- Don’t Think you need to be super passionate at any moment
- Your passion doesn’t need to be productive
- Passions aren’t something tangible and specific
- Passion gives you energy and does not take it away
- You can have more than one passion
- You have to take a risk
- It is a never-ending search

# Find it

- Turn back consumption and search for activities that give dopamine → social media detox
- Try different things out and provide enough time to try
- Don’t be afraid of failure and of the expectations from other people
- Time is no excuse, set personal priorities
- You are not following your passion, your passion follows you
