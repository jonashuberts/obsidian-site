1. The biggest distractions are Internal Triggers. To avoid feeling inner turmoil, we steer towards these distractions.
2. Use Social Media and Email at set times, in one solid block.
3. Surf the urge, noticing what is that we're experiencing. Allow the distraction to crest (rise) and then pass.
4. Beware of "liminal moments". Beware of time when you're transitioning from one task to another.
5. Remember, you're not powerless. Belief is important. Belief to be better and don't believe in the lie that there's nothing we can do.
6. Minimize distractions - focus + structure, turn mobile and internet off
7. Declutter your mind and workspace
8. Have a ready to resume plan, so you can start directly and don't think about the last task you did any more
9. Stop at the middle of a sentence so it becomes more easy to continue than to stop at the end of a paragraph. So the next time you have a ready to resume plan.
10. 40 Hz Music can help to focus but it only works with headphones -> binaural beats
11. Keep your physical and digital workspace clean
12. Work with the Pomodoro method (25/5, 50/10, 90/20)
13. Stick to your calendar
14. Learn with fixed Pomodro times but practice till you have accomplished a certain task and then make the short break
15. Do work into play
