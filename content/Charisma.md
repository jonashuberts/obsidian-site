- Move, gesticulate while you’re speaking ( move hands ... )
- Commit to what you express ( for example : when you tell a story, do imitations etc ... )
- Fully embrace awkwardness : don’t show the embarrassment if you’re disconcerted, go further : for example, if a friend is teasing you, double down the joke, tell your own embarrassing story, etc ...
- Use words with packed emotions, you can use somehow hyperboles while you’re telling a story for example ... It can be words like : amazing, best, ... to describe little things
- Have fun with the group, laugh at the jokes ...
- And the last one and the most important : do not pay attention to what people think, it’s worthless, be yourself a 100%
