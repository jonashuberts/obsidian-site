# GPS Presentation
Hello ==everyone==! Ever wondered how your ==smartphone== magically guides you to the nearest ==pizza== place? It's all thanks to GPS, the Global Positioning System. Let's explore how GPS affects our lives.

GPS was started by the U.S. Department of ==Defense== in 1973 and became operational in 1993. It was made public in 2000 to give civilians access to a non-degraded signal around the world. GPS satellites carry atomic ==clocks== for accurate timekeeping. 

It relies on 24 ==satellites== in orbit, each completing an ==orbit== every 12 hours. ==Receivers== determine their location by measuring the time it takes for signals to reach them. The use of at least four satellites and trilateration makes GPS data highly accurate.

GPS is an integral part of navigation for ==airplanes==, ==ships==, ==cars==, and more. It also ==synchronizes time== around the world, ensuring accuracy across different systems and devices.

Despite its usefulness, obstacles such as gravity and atmospheric distortion affect ==GPS signals==. Stations track and ==correct== the signals, accounting for the mass-time complexity.

Here's another question for all of you: Guess how accurate your average smartphone's GPS location is?

- A) Within 40 meters
- B) Within 5 meters
- C) Within 1 meter

Let's see who thinks they know the answer. Please raise your arms if you think the correct answer is...

The correct answer is: B

Other countries have their own systems, including Russia's ==GLONASS==, Europe's ==Galileo==, and China's ==BeiDou==.

In conclusion, ==GPS== is more than a navigation tool; it's a global network that shapes our ==lives==. Let's appreciate its precision and impact. Thank you for exploring the world of GPS with us!
