# Beautiful writing

- Each letter identical in form
- The distance between the words is equal to the width of the lowercase "n"
- All letters bellies must be closed
- Spacing between letters should be close and regular, but must not touch each other

# Fast writing

- Do not use ink eraser / Tippex → cross out words
- Replace complex letters with simple letters
- Hold the pen in a comfortable position
- Write smaller so you have less line breaks
- Memorize text modules → [https://studyflix.de/deutsch/satzanfange-3838](https://studyflix.de/deutsch/satzanfange-3838)
- Practice every day to become faster → stopwatch
- Use a pencil or other pen that does not need to be pressed down as hard
