# Train Voice

- Yawn
- Barefoot bouncing on heels, creating an almost deep tribal sound
- Don't stand artificially straight, don't lift your shoulders back, don't arch your back, don't lift your chin, don't pull in your stomach or tighten your abdominal muscles it comes by itself
- Lobbing voice over an imaginary area in front of you â†’ no problem if the pitch rises
- Vocal range siren

# Good [[Charisma]]

- Speak a little softer and go up and down with voice
- tell the story with facial expressions and gestures before the actual words are spoken
- tingling narrative voice
- Address only positive things and let the listener fill in the rest if necessary
- use aesthetic words
