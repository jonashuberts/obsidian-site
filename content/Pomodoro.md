- Study for 25 minutes completely concentrated without distractions
- Take a 5-minute break, if it is the fourth repetition take a 30-minute break
- Repeat this process until you have reached the daily [[Goal]]
- If you're getting to distracted try to work as long as you have done the task and then make a short break before doing the next round
