**1. Throw away the checklist** - have no specific type, be open
**2. Overcome the hesitater mindset** - get ritt off excuses not to start dating, start small
**3. Don't fall into the interview trap** - don't do a boring job interview, get creative an do something while dating
**4. The peak end rule** - end the date in a meaningful, fun, polite way
**5. The second date rule** - assume that you go to the second date, first date is to warm up
**6. The experiential mindset** - look how you feel and not judge them messure them at achievements
**7. Basement person vs penthouse person** - motivates you to meet the person, gives you energy or drains it it
**8. Treat it like an experiment** - you have to go to more than one date to find the person you are searching for, so treat it as an experiment
**9. Know your blind spots** - know if you are a romanticiser = find soulmate, hasitor = thinks he is not ready for dating yet, maximizer = look for the person who is the most suitable person
**10. Don't let perfect be the enemy of great** - don't waste time for finding the perfect match, search for faster great dates and not to over think it
**11. Stop looking for prom dates** - look for a long term partner -> emotional stable and kind, find someone with a growth mindset, find someone who can fight well
**12. Spread your wings** - we don't know what we want, the spark is not important, always go on a second Date expect the other person is a psychopath
**13. Decide, don't slide** - actively decide for big decisions, do pros and cons and talk before making the decision
