- Acknowledge that perfectionism can hinder progress and productivity
- Recognize the tendency of perfectionists to avoid failure, leading to procrastination
- Perfectionism can lead to burnout due to excessive standards and sacrifices
- Perfectionism stems from deficit thinking, feeling not good enough
- Imposter syndrome is common among perfectionists, feeling inadequate despite achievements
- Social media can exacerbate feelings of perfectionism through upward social comparison
## Overcoming Perfectionism:

- Surrender to the natural flow of life, accepting failure as part of the process
- Reframe failure as a learning opportunity and normalize its occurrence
- Step outside of your comfort zone regularly to challenge perfectionist tendencies
- Sketch out goals with flexibility rather than rigid specificity
- Focus on NE term goals: Input-based, Controllable, and Energizing
- Explore the fear of imperfection intentionally to diminish its power
- Practice gratitude for progress made and embrace imperfection as part of growth
## Positive Mindset and Self-Acceptance:

- Telling yourself that you are enough
- There is no perfect state
- Errors are good
- Decide when 80% is enough
- Be grateful for what has been achieved so far
- Carefully discard perfectionism, acknowledging that you are not perfectly imperfect
- Intentionally do less/be worse and observe the outcomes, noting any negative effects

- Perfect is undefined; the perfect state exists only in the mind
- Accept error and imperfection as part of the journey
- Increase self-esteem and self-compassion
- Recognize that you do not have to be liked by everyone
- Do not make your feelings dependent on others' opinions.
