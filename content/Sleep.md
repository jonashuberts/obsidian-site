# Methods to fall asleep

## Navy method

- Relax your facial muscles, including your tongue, jaw, and the muscles around your eyes
- Focus on your shoulders and let them fall loosely and as far as possible. Then relax your upper and lower arms, including the hands
- Breathe out calmly while relaxing your chest
- Relax your legs from top to bottom
- Clear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene
- If this doesn’t work, try saying the words “don’t think” over and over for 10 seconds

## 4-7-8-Breathing

- Let your lips part slightly and make a whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
- Then close your lips and inhale silently through your nose. Count to 4 in your head.
- Then hold your breath for 7 seconds.
- After, exhale (with a whoosh sound) for 8 seconds.
- Avoid being too alert at the end of each cycle. Try to practice it mindlessly.
- Complete this cycle for four full breaths. Let your body sleep if you feel relaxation coming on earlier than anticipated.

## **Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)***

- Raise your eyebrows as high as possible for 5 seconds. This will tighten your forehead muscles.
- Relax your muscles immediately and feel the tension drop. Wait 10 seconds.
- Smile widely to create tension in your cheeks. Hold for 5 seconds. Relax.
- Pause for 10 seconds.
- Squint with your eyes shut. Hold 5 seconds. Relax.
- Pause for 10 seconds.
- Tilt your head slightly back, so you’re comfortable looking at the ceiling. Hold 5 seconds. Relax as your neck sinks back into the pillow.
- Pause for 10 seconds.
- Keep moving down the rest of the body, from your triceps to chest, thighs to feet.
- Let yourself fall asleep, even if you don’t finish tensing and relaxing the rest of your body.

## **Tell yourself to stay awake***

- Also called paradoxical intention, telling yourself to stay awake may be an excellent way to fall asleep faster

## ***Visualize a calm place**

- For example, you can imagine a waterfall, the sounds of echoing, rushing water, and the scent of damp moss
- The key is to let this image take up space in your brain to prevent yourself from “re-engaging with thoughts, worries, and concerns” pre-sleep

## **Acupressure for sleep***

- **Spirit gate**
    1. Feel for the small, hollow space under your palm on your pinky side.
    2. Gently apply pressure in a circular or up-and-down movement for 2 to 3 minutes.
    3. Press down the left side of the point (palm facing) with gentle pressure for a few seconds, and then hold the right side (back-of-hand facing).
    4. Repeat on the same area of your other wrist.
- **Inner frontier gate**
    1. On one palm facing up, count three finger-widths down from your wrist crease.
    2. With your thumb, apply a steady downward pressure between the two tendons.
    3. You can massage in a circular or up-and-down motion until you feel your muscles relax.
- **Wind pool**
    1. Interlock your fingers together (fingers out and palms touching) and open up your palms to create a cup shape with your hands.
    2. Position your thumbs at the base of your skull, with thumbs touching where your neck and head connect.
    3. Apply a deep and firm pressure, using circular or up-and-down movements to massage this area.
    4. Breathe deeply and pay attention to how your body relaxes as you exhale.
